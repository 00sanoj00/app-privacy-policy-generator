# Development

The web app uses [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) and is deployed to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

In order to work with the web app and Firebase hosting you would need to setup Firebase CLI.

### Setup Firebase CLI

The instructions to set it up differ based on the operating system, which is explained [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

However you can also use the below command to setup/update the Firebase CLI, which will take care of everything (including detecting the OS you are running):

```bash
curl -sL firebase.tools | bash
```

### Test locally

To serve locally for testing, run: `firebase serve --only hosting`

### Deploy to Production

> Note: This can only be done by maintainers who have access to Firebase console!

- First, login by executing command: `firebase login`
- Next,To deploy to production,run: `firebase deploy -m "2.1.11"`
